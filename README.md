  Programming
</h2>

This repository contains a collection of simple `Clojure` programs to help beginners learn the basics of the language.

### Running the Programs

Each program is located in its own directory within the `src` folder. To run a program, navigate to its directory and use the `clj` command (from `CLI`).

You can run a `clojure` file by using following command

```sh
clj <filename>.clj [arg1] [arg2]  [arg_n]
```
